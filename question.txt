Challenge: Build a Responsive Product Card

We’re excited to see your skills in action! 

For this challenge, you’ll create a responsive product card component using Tailwind CSS.

Requirements:

The card should include:

 
1. An image (you can use a placeholder or any relevant product image).

2. A title (e.g., "Product Name") and a short description.

3. A 'Buy Now' button. 

Ensure the card is responsive.  It should look great on both mobile and desktop devices. Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling and responsiveness.
Expectations:

Showcase your understanding of Tailwind's responsive utilities (e.g., sm:, md:, lg:). Demonstrate clean, well-structured code that follows best practices. The design doesn’t need to be overly complex—focus on functionality and responsiveness.
